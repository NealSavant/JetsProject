## Jets Week 4 Project

### Overview

Program creates a list of jets with different capabilities. The user can view information on the jets as well as add and remove jets from the list. Carrier planes and fighter jets are subclasses of Jet and implement unique interfaces.

### Concepts

Class hierarchies

Abstract classes

Interfaces

ArrayList

FileReader

try catch

### Technologies Used

Java

Eclipse.ide

regex


### Lessons Learned

Working with Lists and calling object types from child classes took some practice. The implementation of constructors within the inheritance hierarchies also took some research and consideration. I am comfortable with the project requirements and am looking to apply the java stack to front or back end representations.
